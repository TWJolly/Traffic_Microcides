    "This notebook takes traffic volume and accident data from the DfT and estimates the number of microcides that are attributable to a variety of vehicle types. Please see my blog article (link) regarding microcides.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are essentially estimates of the marginal increase in deaths. We want to be able to say, for example, how much the risk to others changes if you cycle instead of drive a given distance. On this basis I tried to attribute ‘blame’ for each death in each accident in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "A vehicle should be ‘blamed’ to the degree to which its absence from the road would have prevented the deaths. Given the complex and diverse ways in which road accidents are caused I relied on a heuristic to come up with the estimates in Table 1.\n",
    "For single vehicle accidents no one is blamed (risk to oneself is ignored as these are not microcides).\n",
    "In two vehicle crashes each death is blamed on the other vehicle. \n",
    "For each death in larger accidents the largest of the other vehicle types involved in the accident are all blamed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The 'Vehicle_Encoding' dictionary variable in this notebook (code cell 6) defines the size ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of multi-vehicle crashes:\n",
    "1.\tIf a crash involving two bicycles and a car occurs in which one cyclist dies. The driver is blamed but the other cyclist is not. \n",
    "2.\tIf an accident involving a car, a pedestrian and a HGV results in the deaths of the HGV driver and the pedestrian. The HGV is blamed for the pedestrian’s death and car is blamed for the HGV driver’s death.\n",
    "3.\tIf an accident involving two cars and a pedestrian results in the death of the pedestrian, both cars are blamed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that an accident's causes will become harder to identify as they become larger I needed to ignore accidents above a given size for the heuristic to hold. See the Appendix for the justification for using 4 as the maximum accident size. This could produce an incorrectly low microcide value for vehicle types that are typically involved in large accidents. Given the rarity of accidents with large numbers of vehicles I doubt this is a significant problem."
